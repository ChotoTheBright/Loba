# Loba
Small Wolfenstein-like engine for Godot 3.5.x.

This is an active WIP, more updates to follow.


Originally conceived by RDParedes as doom-godot :: https://github.com/rdparedes/doom-godot.

The repo was abandoned for over five years, so I decided to go in and see if I could get it working on the latest version of Godot 3. I will also try (hopefully!) to get this ported over to Godot 4 and Mono. I might need help from a friend for that one, we'll see. One step at a time.
