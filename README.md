Small Wolfenstein-like engine for Godot 3.5.x. This is an active WIP, more updates to follow.


Originally conceived by RDParedes as doom-godot :: https://github.com/rdparedes/doom-godot.

The repo was abandoned for over five years, so I decided to go in and try to get it working with Godot 3.5. Long story short, I was able to get it back up and running after a few days of tinkering and adjusting. It works with both Static Bodies and Tilesets. I will also try my best to get this ported over to Godot 4 and Mono. I might need help from a friend for that one, we'll see. One step at a time.
